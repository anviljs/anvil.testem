## Anvil HTTP Plugin
Provides an integrated web host using express and socket.io. Extends anvil with functionality to allow other plugins to host features and content.

This plugin requires anvil.js version 0.8.* or greater.

## Installation

	anvil install anvil.http

## Usage

	anvil --host

	anvil --host --browser

### --browser
Automatically open a browser tab in your default browser pointed to the root url. Why? Because it's awesome.

## Configuration
Configuration can be changed by adding any of the three properties to the build file under "anvil.http": {}.

### "contentTypes"
A hash where the key is the extension of the requested file and the value is the mimeType specification. In general, this is only necessary if you're adding support for a file extension that needs to be compiled on the fly. 

Example:
	"contentTypes": { 
		".coffee": "application/javascript"
	}

### "port"
Specifies what port the server will listen to. The default is 3080.

Example:

	"port": 3080
			
### "paths"
A hash where the key is the relative url to map to a specific directory or file. The following example shows the default setting which causes the output directory to get mapped to the top level.

Example:
			
	"paths": {
		"/": anvil.config.output
	}

## API
Currently the only call that this plugin adds to anvil is registerPath.

### registerPath( url, filePath )
This lets you register static files to serve at a specific relative url
